# Compare the two numbers, if it’s the same number, display a success message, 
# otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

# import random

#def compare_numbers(user_number):
#    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
#    print("Generated random number:", random_number)

#    if user_number == random_number:
#        print("Success! The numbers match.")
#    else:
#        print("Fail! The numbers don't match.")
    
#    print(f"User's number: {user_number}, random number: {random_number}")

#user_input = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))
#compare_numbers(user_input)
