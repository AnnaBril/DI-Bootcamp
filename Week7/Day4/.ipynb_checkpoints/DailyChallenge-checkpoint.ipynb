    "- Definition: Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the input data is paired with corresponding output labels. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping between input features and their corresponding target labels, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n",

Once trained, the model can predict whether new, unseen emails are spam or not based on these learned patterns.\n",

The agent takes actions (like moving, jumping, or shooting) in the game environment, and the game provides feedback in the form of scores or penalties based on the agent's performance. The agent learns to improve its strategy over multiple interactions to maximize its final score, representing the goal of winning the game."
