    "Identifying relevant features for predicting loan defaults is a crucial step in building an effective predictive model. The choice of features depends on their potential impact on the likelihood of default. Here's a list of features that might be relevant for predicting loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repayment History:**\n",
    "Justification: A borrower's past repayment behavior is a strong indicator of their creditworthiness. Features such as the number of late payments, missed payments, or defaults on previous loans provide insights into the borrower's financial responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Credit Score:**\n",
    "Justification: Credit scores summarize an individual's credit history and are widely used by financial institutions to assess credit risk. A lower credit score may indicate a higher likelihood of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Income:**\n",
    "Justification: The borrower's income is a key factor in determining their ability to repay a loan. Higher income levels generally correlate with a lower risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loan Amount:**\n",
    "Justification: The amount of the loan is important in assessing the borrower's financial capacity to handle the debt. High loan amounts relative to income might increase the risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Employment History:**\n",
    "Justification: Stability in employment is often associated with a lower risk of default. A consistent employment history suggests a reliable source of income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age:**\n",
    "Justification: Age can be indicative of financial stability and responsibility. Younger individuals may have less established financial histories, while older individuals may have more stable financial situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debt-to-Income Ratio:**\n",
    "Justification: The ratio of debt to income provides an understanding of the borrower's overall financial health. A higher ratio may indicate a higher risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Number of Dependents:**\n",
    "Justification: The number of dependents can impact an individual's disposable income. More dependents might increase financial obligations and affect the ability to repay a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of the Loan:**\n",
    "Justification: The reason for taking out a loan can provide insights into the borrower's financial decision-making. Certain purposes may carry a higher risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outstanding Debt:**\n",
    "Justification: The total amount of existing debt can influence a borrower's ability to manage additional financial obligations. High outstanding debt may increase the risk of default.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collateral:**\n",
    "Justification: For secured loans, the presence and value of collateral can act as a mitigating factor. It provides an additional layer of assurance for the lender in case of default.\n",
