# Daily Challenge: Real-World Data Analysis Scenarios

# The article "Big Data and Machine Learning against COVID-19: 3 cases about coronavirus and artificial intelligence" highlights 
# the role of data analysis and machine learning in the fight against the pandemic. 
# Three key cases are being discussed:

# 1. Interactive Sites and Big Data: The role of highly loaded Big Data systems, such as the Yandex dashboard, which provides information about COVID-19 cases in near real-time mode, is emphasized. 
# Data transparency and aggregation play an important role in understanding the situation.

# 2. BlueDot and Machine Learning: BlueDot is being introduced, a machine learning system that analyzes news, 
# official statements and even indirect data in real time, predicting not only the place where the epidemic began, but also its further spread.

# 3. Automatic Diagnostics and Robots in China: The article describes an automatic diagnosis system for COVID-19 using machine learning algorithms 
# and a robot that non-contact measures body temperature and monitors compliance with medical measures in quarantine conditions.

# 4. Vaccine Research Using Machine Learning: The use of Data Science methods, including machine learning, to study the structure of COVID-19 
# proteins in order to develop vaccines and medicines is emphasized.

# The article demonstrates how a variety of data analysis and artificial intelligence techniques have played a critical role in understanding, 
# preventing and combating the coronavirus pandemic.
